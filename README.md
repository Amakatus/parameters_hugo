# Hugo Configuration Files

These are the configuration files for my Hugo website. They include various settings for site appearance, menu structure, language preferences, and other customizations.

Feel free to explore the files to see how the theme and site structure are configured.

Technologies Used 🛠️

This site is built with Hugo, a popular static site generator that allows me to quickly create and publish quality content 📝.
